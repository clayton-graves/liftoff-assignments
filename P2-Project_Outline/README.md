## Submission Instructions

### Overview

  Dieting can be a pain in the ass. What I aspire to do is build an application that will do all of the searching and calorie/nutrient counting for me. While I am still working out the specifics, basically, you will input certain parameters for your diet (calories, carbs, protiens, etc.) and the application will generate a list of what you can still eat in compliance with your diet. The list will be seperated into groups of meats, veggies, fruits, nuts and breads. 

### Features

Users will be able to register/signup. They will have access to the nutrition database where they can search for certain things or things with certain characteristics. Users will also be able to save certain foods which they've come to like or find beneficial to a list which will be linked only to the user that created the list.

### Technologies

Java
CSS
HTML
SpringBoot
BootStrap
Thymeleaf
SQL
MAMP

### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn how to access an open database and possibly how to export to a csv file. I will also have to learn how to hash and salt, possibly even pepper passwords. I have never actually incorporated bootstrap into a project myself so I will have to learn that as well. I'm sure there are more things that I will have to learn I just haven't encountered them yet.
